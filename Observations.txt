Light/Heat - Adding the factor of an increase of light and heat amount caused a significant decrease in the mass of the plant because transpiration is dictated by the temperature of the area the increase of heat would increase the rate of transpiration resulting in a higher decrease of mass.

Dark - Dark had moderately similar lost in mass to the control plant because the absence of light reduces the rate of transpiration because in the plants stomata they close in the absence of light to restore water, although other factors could relate to this such as the humidity of the covered plant or temperature transpiration still occurs just at a moderately faster rate.


Humid - A humid area had significantly low decrease in mass because a humid environment typically slows down the rate of transpiration because the plant lacks circulation that would allow the water on the plan evaporate into the area.
